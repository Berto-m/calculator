# Calculator

Live Demo: https://albertomdev.github.io/calculator/

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum.

I am not a UI designer, so I like to take inspiration from other creators. Cloning projects from creators that are better than me, forces me think hard and google a lot. This time I tried to clone the iPhone's calculators with a few extra features.

## Feedback

Feedback to improve or expand the calculator is welcome
